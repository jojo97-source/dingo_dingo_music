# dingo_dingo_music

A new Flutter application for school project.
A music application that includes:
1) Local music Player (Local storage)
2) Online music Player (using deezer api)
3) Online radio player

I do not own deezer, nor it's api. This project is for school purposes.
This  uses API from Deezer to get music catalogue. Deezer API provides you some global parameters in order to simplify and organize your requests . Deezer give unlimited Access, without stress, without identification. Deezer Simple API provides a nice set of services to build up web applications allowing the discovery of Deezer's music catalogue.
